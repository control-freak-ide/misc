# Control-Freak - v3

## General changes

- All features will be split into components even more 
- All components can be run as stand-alone
- All components have to provide some instrospection information such as platform-capability, user ACL, provided commands (per data structure/file format).
- Components can be re-composed into new 'verticals' which then later can be listed in a catalog
- Components can be re-composed into new components with the help of visual mapping tools as seen in 'Virtools'. I proposed this earlier in regard of xblox & behaviours
- Components provide 'commands' aka 'actions'. These commands must be compatible with the user's selection. 
- Each component's outlets (commands) and intakes may provide different implementations per interface (console, ui, micro-service)

## User - interface changes
